# Fire Weather Index Analysis and Prediction
This project aims to analyze and predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using various machine learning techniques. The FWI is a rating of fire intensity that measures the potential for wildfire based on weather conditions. By leveraging historical weather data and the corresponding FWI values, this project implements regression models to forecast future FWI values.

# Features
